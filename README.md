In this assignment you will have to implement algorithm 9J from the book: Reconstructing a string from its Burrows Wheeler Transform.

The assignment is available in Gradescope as: https://www.gradescope.com/courses/358896/assignments/1822250 (Links to an external site.) .  For additional details, you can also see problem BA9J on Rosalind: http://rosalind.info/problems/ba9j/ (Links to an external site.) .

For this assignment your code should expect one file that contains exactly one line. The text of that one line represents the Burrows Wheeler Transform of a string, for example:

TCCT$AA
Your program must create a file called "output" which contains exactly one line, representing the string that was "scrambled" into the transformed version provided as input.  For the example above, your code should generate:

CATCAT$
